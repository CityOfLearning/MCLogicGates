# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Recipes for all ender gates

### Changed
- All redstone recipes
- Removed gate toggling
	- each gate must now be crafted individually

## [0.10.0] - 2016-01-26
### Changed
- BlockRedirector to BlockDirector
	- renamed all BlockDirector associated files

### Fixed
- BlockVerticalRepeater not powering properly
- BlockVerticalRepeater not notifying neighbors properly
- BlockGate not transitioning to proper state on activated
- BlockDirector displaying particles while off

## [0.9.0] - 2016-01-25
### Added
- New Repeater types - all repeaters come in both redstone and ender variants
	- Inverter
		- inverts signal
		- has delay toggle
		- can be locked
	- Converter
		- converts signal
		- has delay toggle
		- can be locked
	- Vertical
		- sends signals vertically
		- can receive signals from all sides except output
		- right click to change orientation (up/down)
	- Redirector
		- redirects signal
		- right click to change orientation (left/right)
	- Gates
		- AND
		- OR
		- NAND
		- NOR
		- XOR
		- XNOR

### Changed
- Name to Logic Gates
- All repeaters to new variants
- All recipes
- Removed all Caster Blocks

## [0.8.0] - 2016-01-19
### Added
- RR Caster
- More Caster on place orientation options
	- if placed on other Diode's face, will try to connect input to output or vice versa
	- if sneaking, will connect input to hit Block's face
	- otherwise defaults to same as BlockRedstoneRepeater
- More Caster I/O configuration by block activation
	- right click input or output to invert
	- shift + right click input to move output opposite of input
	- shift + right click output to move input opposite of output

### Changed

### Fixed
- Mod showing wrong version number
- Caster reorienting to default state when attempting to change input or output to invalid side
- Diode base texture

## [0.6.0] - 2016-01-12
